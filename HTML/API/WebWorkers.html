  Web workers :
  ============
some time large caluculation means more CPU intensive tasks need to do in script on that time webpage performance issues occured 

so we can over come this issue by using web workers 

A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. 
You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

it is runs external js file only
