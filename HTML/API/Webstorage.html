  Web storages:
  ============
these are used to store data locally within user's browser , for user track or temporary storage access
Before HTML5, the data storage used by cookie in every server request it has drawbacks we can store only limited data only and 
text data only can store and not secure
by using web storages we can store large amount of data can store locally , without web performance issues 

it can store per one origin (domain and proto cal) and can access in all pages same data


we have two methods 

1) local storage :
==================

=> no expiration time means if you close tab or browser data wont delete 
=> and will be available the next day, week, or year.


syntax :
=======
for setting:

localStorage.setItem("key","value");
to get:
localStorage.getItem("key");

single item :

localStorage.key_name = "value";

localStorage.key_name;

remove localStorage :

localStorage.removeItem(key_name);


2) session storages :
====================
=> it is also same as local  storage

=> It store data temporary or one session  means when u close tab or browser it deletes the data


sessionStorage.setItem("key","value");
to get:
sessionStorage.getItem("key");
Before using web storage, check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage:

if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
}
